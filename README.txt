== Description ==

WP-Tincan is a powerful teaching tool developed to help teachers track progress and study the users who are learning from them. Teachers may create courses, lessons, and quizzes and is integrated with BBpress. The teacher may upload PDFâ€™s and podcasts as well to help get the lesson to users. When a user reads a lesson, views a course, or takes a quiz, WP-Tincan will automatically send a Tincan statement to the teacher saying which user did what. Using WP-Tincan will hopefully help the teacher understand what the user taking their course needs by letting the teacher know exactly what the user is doing.
